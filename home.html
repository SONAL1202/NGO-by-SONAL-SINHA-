      "old-is-gold" is the old proverb defining the importance and presence of some-one seniour in our family.Every moment is pleasant and perfect moment when we have some old people with us .family become complete.As they become older and older they are experienced who guides us in every tough journey of life successfully. So Senior citizens are very respectable person of the country. The person who has crossed the age of 60 and lives permanently in a same country is the known as Senior Citizen of that country.They need help to fulfill their work. So it' s our responsibility to take care of them. As they are the roots of our life. They are the person who nurtured us to bloom like a flower. We should never forget the truth that it is because of them we are enjoying our life on this planet.Now its our turn to thanks them by caring them like a child and give respect to them like a God.
